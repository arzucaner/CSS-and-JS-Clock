# CSS and JS Clock

---


## This project is part of the JavaScript30 Challenge, a coding challenge created by Wes Bos. The specific project is called "CSS and JS Clock" and it involves creating a dynamic clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main objective of this project is to create a clock that displays the current time in a visually appealing way. The clock is designed using CSS to create the clock face, hour, minute, and second hands. JavaScript is then used to update the rotation angles of the clock hands based on the current time, making the clock display the correct time in real-time.

The project also includes custom CSS animations and transitions to create a smooth, visually appealing animation of the clock hands moving. The clock is fully responsive, adjusting its size and layout based on the screen size of the device it is viewed on.
